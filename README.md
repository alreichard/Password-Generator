# Password Generator

This project allows for the user to choose from a list of password criteria: length, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, numbers, and characters. After they choose what they want, a random password, fitting tht criteria, will be generated. 

The point of this project was for me to be able to explore different statements and loops including if statements, for loops and while loops. Through this project I was able to grasp all three. It also introduced me to the techniques required to connect HTML files to js files. 

The most fun part about this was figuring out how to restart incase certain requirement weren't met (wasnt long enough or no characters selected). The while loop with a condition that could be fufilled or not worked well for this.
